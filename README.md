                <h2>History</h2>
                <p>Maroon 5 is an American pop rock band from Los Angeles, California.It currently consists of lead vocalist Adam Levine, 
                    keyboardist and rhythm guitarist Jesse Carmichael, bassist Mickey Madden, lead guitarist James Valentine, drummer Matt Flynn,
                    keyboardist PJ Morton, and multi-instrumentalist Sam Farrar. Original members Levine, Carmichael, Madden, and drummer Ryan 
                    Dusick first came together as Kara's Flowers in 1994, while they were still in high school. After self-releasing their 
                    independent album We Like Digging?, the band signed to Reprise Records and released the album The Fourth World in 1997. 
                    The album garnered a tepid response, after which the record label dropped the band and the members focused on college. 
                    In 2001, the band re-emerged as Maroon 5, pursuing a different direction and adding guitarist Valentine. The band 
                    signed with Octone Records, an independent record label with a separate joint venture relationship with J Records 
                    and released their debut album Songs About Jane in June 2002. Aided by its lead single, "Harder to Breathe", which 
                    received heavy airplay, the album peaked at number six on the Billboard 200 chart, and went platinum in 2004. 
                    The band won the Grammy Award for Best New Artist in 2005. In 2006, Dusick left the band after suffering from 
                    serious wrist and shoulder injuries and was replaced by Matt Flynn.</p>

                    <h2>Genre</h2>
                    <p>Maroon 5's musical style has generally been regarded as pop, pop rock, funk rock, dance-pop, blue-eyed soul, neo soul,
                        R&B, and soft rock.</p>
                    <p>Adam Levine has stated: "Everything that's written and performed and put together pretty much comes from us. I just 
                        think people would be surprised to know that we're a self-contained unit. We're a band that does their own thing. 
                        There's no puppet master." However, in an article about the songwriter and producer Benny Blanco, it is revealed 
                        that at least some of the band's songs, such as "Moves like Jagger," are the product of efforts by, or collaborations
                         with, professional songwriters and producers. In the same article, Levine says, "It's almost as if [Benny Blanco] has
                         the Midas touch in putting the right people together at the right time to create a musical moment. He's about the 
                        collaboration. And he's so good at nailing down who does everything best."</p>
                    <p>The band has cited Michael Jackson, The Beatles, The Police, Justin Timberlake, Stevie Wonder, the Bee Gees, Tonic, 
                        Prince, Tupac Shakur and Marvin Gaye as influences.</p>
                    <p>Adam Levine has also cited Billy Joel as an influence. Furthermore, guitarist James Valentine said he was influenced by
                        guitarists like Pat Metheny, Bill Frisell and John Scofield, as well as the rock band Queens of the Stone Age. The 
                        band's songs tend to be very guitar-heavy, often accompanied by piano or synthesizer. The theme in most of their songs 
                        is love, frequently lost love; songs like "This Love", "Makes Me Wonder" and "Misery" have a very cynical tone, often 
                        expressing dissatisfaction with a relationship, while their more heartfelt and emotional songs such as "She Will Be 
                        Loved" and "Never Gonna Leave This Bed" express a longing for a romantic relationship. "Makes Me Wonder" has a 
                        secondary theme, in which Levine expresses his disillusionment and frustration with the state of American politics and 
                        the Iraq War.</p>

                    <h2>Controversy</h2>
                    <p>Maroon 5’s plan to perform at the Super Bowl halftime show this Sunday has weathered several controversies.
                            The band’s been criticised for deciding to play after Rihanna and Cardi B turned down the gig over the NFL’s
                             treatment of Colin Kaepernick. Fans of “Spongebob Squarepants” want Maroon 5 to pay tribute to Stephen Hillenberg,
                             the show’s creator, who died last year.
